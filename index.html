        Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) was an English mathematician known for her work on Charles Babbage's
        proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
        recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first
        algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
